Use the Translator API in Chrome to translate text with AI models provided in
the browser.

Your website may already offer website content in multiple languages. With the
Translator API, users can write in their first language. For example, users
can participate in support chats in their first language, and your site can
translate their message into your support agents' first language, before the
message leaves the user's device. This creates a smooth, fast, and inclusive
experience for all users.

Translation of web content typically requires using a cloud service.
First, the source content is uploaded to a server, which runs the translation to
a target language, then the resulting text is downloaded and returned to the
user. When the content is ephemeral and doesn't warrant saving to a database,
client-side translation saves time and cost over a hosted translation service.

## Get started

Run feature detection to see if the browser supports the Translator API.

    if ('Translator' in self) {
      // The Translator API is supported.
    }

| **Tip:** Use the [@types/dom-chromium-ai](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@types/dom-chromium-ai) npm package to get TypeScript typings for the Prompt API and other built-in AI APIs for easier access in your codebase.

While you always know the target language for translations, you may not always
know the source language. In such cases, you can use the
[Language Detector API](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/ai/language-detection).

### Model download

The Translator API uses an expert model trained to generate high-quality
translations. The API is built into Chrome, and the model is downloaded
the first time a website uses this API.

To determine if the model is ready to use, call the asynchronous
[`Translator.availability()`](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/ai/get-started#model-download) function.
If the response to `availability()` is `downloadable`, listen for download
progress to inform the user of its progress, as it may take time.
| **Note:** The Translator API hides the download status of specific language pairs, to protect user privacy. Instead, all language pairs are reported as downloadable until individual sites create a translator for a given pair.

### Check language pair support

Translation is managed with language packs, downloaded on demand. A language
pack is like a dictionary for a given language.

- `sourceLanguage`: The current language for the text.
- `targetLanguage`: The final language the text should be translated into.

Use [BCP 47](https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/bcp47) language short codes as
strings. For example, `'es'` for Spanish or `'fr'` for French.

    const translatorCapabilities = await Translator.availability({
      sourceLanguage: 'es',
      targetLanguage: 'fr',
    });
    // 'available'

Listen for model download progress with the `downloadprogress` event:

    const translator = await Translator.create({
      sourceLanguage: 'es',
      targetLanguage: 'fr',
      monitor(m) {
        m.addEventListener('downloadprogress', (e) => {
          console.log(`Downloaded ${e.loaded * 100}%`);
        });
      },
    });

If the download fails, then `downloadprogress` events stop and
the `ready` promise is rejected.

### Create and run the translator

To create a translator, check for
[user activation](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/ai/get-started#user-activation)
and call the asynchronous `create()` function. The Translator `create()`
function requires an options parameter with two fields, one for the
`sourceLanguage` and one for the `targetLanguage`.

    // Create a translator that translates from English to French.
    const translator = await Translator.create({
      sourceLanguage: 'en',
      targetLanguage: 'fr',
    });

Once you have a translator, call the asynchronous `translate()`.

    await translator.translate('Where is the next bus stop, please?');
    // "Où est le prochain arrêt de bus, s'il vous plaît ?"

Alternatively, if you need to deal with longer texts, you can also use the
streaming version of the API and call `translateStreaming()`.

    const stream = translator.translateStreaming(longText);
    for await (const chunk of stream) {
      console.log(chunk);
    }

### Sequential translations

Translations are processed sequentially. If you send large amounts of text to be
translated, subsequent translations are blocked until the earlier ones complete.

For the best response to your requests, chunk them together and add a
[loading interface](https://web.dev/articles/building/a-loading-bar-component),
such as a spinner, to convey that translation is ongoing.

## Demo

You can see the Translator API, used in combination with the Language Detector
API, in the
[Translator and Language Detector API playground](https://chrome.dev/web-ai-demos/translation-language-detection-api-playground/).

## Permission Policy, iframes, and Web Workers

By default, the Translator API is only available to top-level windows and to
same-origin iframes. Access to the API can be delegated to cross-origin iframes
using the [Permissions Policy](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/privacy-security/permissions-policy#usage)
`allow=""` attribute:

    <!--
      The host site https://main.example.com can grant a cross-origin iframe
      at https://cross-origin.example.com/ access to the Translator API by
      setting the `allow="translator"` attribute.
    -->
    <iframe src="https://cross-origin.example.com/" allow="translator"></iframe>

The Translator API isn't available in Web Workers, due to the complexity of
establishing a responsible document for each worker, in order to check the
Permissions Policy status.
